"li_struct_results_27tz_222_333.csv" contains lattice parameter "a_min" (in angstrom), bulk modulus "B" (in 100 GPa), and cohesive energy "E_coh" (in E_h) for BCC Li.
In the paper, the "_corrected" versions were used. There, the correlation energy at 444 and a=3.5 ang was used to correct the extrapolated
correlation energy (extrapolated via 222 and 333).
"CCSDT1b_ring" is ring-CCSDT. "CCSDTviaCCSD" and "CCSDT1b_ringviaCCSD" were not used in the paper.
