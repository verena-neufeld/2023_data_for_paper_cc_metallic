The new data for figure 2 can be found in "processed_data/ueg_cbs_tdl/*.csv" files.

The reference DMC *total* energies are rs=1: 0.58640, rs=2: 0.001917, rs=3: -0.067309, rs=4: -0.07771, rs=5: -0.07597,
from which the HF energy in the thermodynamic limit is subtracted to get the DMC correlation energies.
These reference DMC energies are from S. Azadi, N. D. Drummond, S. M. Vinko, PRB 107, L121105, 2023.

To plot figure 2, rs is plotted on the x axis and the ratio of correlation energy of our target methods to the DMC correlation
energy is on the y axis.
