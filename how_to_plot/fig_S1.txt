The data for figure S1 can be found in "raw_data/ueg/raw_results_bald_m_1.5_tol_0.04_rs_4.csv".

To plot figure S1, plot MP2 correlation energy per number of electrons (divide energy given in data file by number
of electrons) against the difference of the relevant triples coupled cluster correlation energy per electron and the
CCSD correlation energy per electron.
